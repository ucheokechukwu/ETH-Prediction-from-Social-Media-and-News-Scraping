I work with a middle school kid in Korea for a couple of hours a week. He reads a book for one class and we do vocab and content-related discussion. For the other class, he watches something (We just finished Wednesday for example) and do something similar (basically it's an attempt to engrain English in all possible forms)

Do you have anything comedic you would recommend for a 14-year-old boy (of the Minecraft variety)? We've done things like Avatar, A Series of Unfortunate Events, etc., but I'm running out of things to show which don't have awkward sex scenes (e.g., the webcam girl in Heroes, something I didn't even remember happening). I wouldn't care if he was my kid, and he's more than mature enough - it's just squidgy considering the context.

2023-06-10 14:36:58,Submission,netflix,First Kill: One-Year Anniversary,"Looking back at one of my favorite LGBT Netflix shows.

Despite having an interesting concept, I went into this show with low expectations. Turns down, this show was much more lovable than anticipated that I finished the entire season in just one day!

The most prominent kudos to the performances of the two young leads and their chemistry, which was obviously the most alluring part of the series. I went in thinking their romance is gonna be completely forced and even unconvincing. Turns out there was a natural setup behind them getting together, and even then, there was a lot of rockiness behind their relationship, largely due to the massive complications between their families, which of course gives ""Romeo & Juliet"" vibes.

There were also some emotional moments between the families, especially during the season finale when people were forced to make hard choices.

I won't pretend that this show didn't have flaws. It did.  It’s low-budget CGI was laughable and there were some blood splatters that looked like something you'd see in a student film. Probably a good thing they kept the visual effects to a minimum. Also, certain concepts it wasn’t very clear on, making some narratives confusing.

2023-06-09 22:30:45,Submission,netflix,XO Kitty - A Train Wreck,"I'll start by saying that I came into XO Kitty with big expectations, probably bigger than they should have been. I was a huge fan of TATBILB and that series of films. The idea that we'd be following Kitty (who was very well-received and liked in the series before) felt like a good one, and to see them located in Korea felt like a fresh take and opportunity to essentially continue a great, yet alternate storyline for the franchise.

With that being said, this show was rough. I tried my hardest to enjoy this show, often telling myself at times that ""it has to get better than this, but to no avail. And I honestly don't know what to blame it on. My gut tells me to blame it on the writers, but there's just so much wrong with this show that it's hard to pin point any one thing that caused it's demise.

The show started with a fairly simple premise. Kitty has a long-distance boyfriend Dae, for whom happens to go to the same exact college that her mother went to. Boom. Right then and there. Simple. A story about Dae and their relationship, as well as her finding and exploring the life that her mother once had at that school and that country.

But man...did it derail from there.

You have a show that is centered around convenience at almost every turn.

Kitty gets hit by a car, a car that happens to be harboring Yuri, who just happens to not only be going to the same exact school as Kitty....but also secretly is having a fake tryst of sorts with....you guessed it, Kitty's long-distance boy friend, Dae. Both speak about their ""relationships"", but the specifics of both of their relationships being with Dae conveniently stays mum.

From there, we quickly find out that Yuri, somewhat randomly, isn't actually with Dae, but more so, is gay, and has an ongoing relationship that she is hiding from here family. And the person in which she has a secret relationship with? Literally, a random as hell token African American girl. Tell us you're not checking a box, just to check a box. And Yuri's mom, again conveniently, is the principal of the school KISS. Go figure.

Fast forward, Kitty tries to surprise Dae at the dance, and you guessed it again, conveniently finds out that Dae is the person that Yuri has been talking to the whole summer.

And then comes all of the utter stupidity from there.

For all the problems the show had, 90% of them could have been answered in the first 2 episodes. If I had a dollar for every time a character tried talking to another character, only to be conveniently interrupted by another character...I'd be rich. I don't know how many times this happened, but it just seemed to be this ongoing screw job from the writers. ""Hey, let me tell you everything....BAM, oh no, my friend just walked in the room, and I have to go, I'll talk to you later about it"". Literally, who the hell does that in the real world? There were at least 4-5 times this happened in the first 2 episodes, and it got to a point where it just felt like the show was taking the audience to be morons.

The show continues on quite a bit with these tasteless conveniences and oddball writing habits, only to find it's way towards the mid point of the season. And this is where everything gets completely derailed for me. The idea of her going to Korea to find out more about her mom seems to just fly out the window completely. What was once a promising (and intriguing storyline heading into the show), feels like it got run over by a train and was left to rot.

We're suddenly introduced to all of these random sub plots. Yuri's father, and his random as hell mini story line...Florian and Q's relationship, that almost at one point, seemed to be more interesting than anything that goes on in the show. To suddenly, the biggest shocker (and not in a good way) of them all....

Kitty suddenly decides that she has feelings for Yuri? The same Yuri that she hated for much of the first 1/2 of the show...until...Yuri did a literally...random AF mini DJ set. And all of a sudden, Dae feels like an after thought, and Kitty is conveniently bi-sexual now? Like where on earth did all of this come from?

This show felt like it had a premise going in, but almost utterly got overthrown by many of the same things we see other shows and films falling prey to. Bad writing, political correctness, storylines that center on LGBTQ communities and the thought process of ""it's ok to be gay"" and ""there shouldn't be a stigma against it"". It felt as though the show almost purposely turned into a soap box rather than actually developing a cohesive, interesting storyline. Kitty's sudden ""bi-ness"" just fell completely under the umbrella of ""uh, what the \_\_\_\_""

The show is just a mess.

The acting is horrible. The writing is even more atrocious. Dae's character was the most utterly boring character to hit television in a long time. I felt the casting for both Dae and Yuri were off the mark. Q and Florian I did like, although Florian seemed to be about as basic and ""expected"" of a choice for the type of character he was portraying.

I honestly left the show thinking...what the hell did I just watch. And man, did I really want this show to be good. Couple in the other random storylines with the principal, the father, all of these really weird love triangles but not love triangles, the writing, the political correctness.

I hoped for more from the show. It will be very curious to me to see how they address season 2 if they do decide to bring it back. There's a lot to fix, and simply put, it really does start with the writing and the story.",anasazigb,t3_145ixdo

**La Casa De Papel**

In general the most important thing for me is interesting characters that I can build a “relationship” to (I am german so sadly I lack a better word for this)

I've heard other causes of the issue could be poor internet connection, but I find that unlikely to be the cause since nothing about my internet has changed between the time that I got Netflix and the time the issue started.

I have a couple of queries and I would appreciate it if you could kindly guide me through:

1. Is it necessary for the added family members to use my login credentials or are they allowed to create their own individual login details?
2. For the children's profiles, if they are to use my login credentials, what prevents them from choosing an adult profile upon signing in? Is there a mechanism in place that helps the system distinguish between an adult and a child user?

This came as a bit of a shock. This can only mean one thing. Netflix wants you to choose the ads plan, or upgrade to the ad-free plan and pay ~ $10 more.

now when you're browsing and stop on a title it autoplays a f-ing trailer, complete with audio! OR just plays random scenes from the movie with random music (maybe from the movie?)

dammit, there's a reason that ""watch trailer"" is an optional button on almost any other movie interface like amazon, or itunes, etc... 

I don't want to watch these trailers every time I pause to look at something! 

holy f---- it's annoying. 

It's like going to the mall and every time you glance towards a store a salesman runs up to you and starts singing about it. Makes you want to leave the mall. fast. 


CLARIFICATION: this is new in the main first window of Netflix with the trending section and movie icons you scroll through to pick. The blurb and picture is now a moving image with sound. This is different than how items auto play from the individual pages

2017-09-10 12:29:19,Submission,netflix,"Disney/Marvel is pulling their library from Netflix in 2019, and DC just pulled theirs out this past August... Both with plans to start up their own streaming services... How many streaming services do these companies think we'll subscribe too?","With Young Justice getting a season 3 soon, I thought I'd rewatch the first two seasons... Well this past August, DC pulled their library of shows off Netflix with the intention of launching their own streaming service in 2018. And Disney just recently announced they will be doing the same, once their contract with Netflix ends in 2019.

I am also an avid anime watcher, and even though Netflix's anime library (including original shows) is growing, they still don't simucast current shows. Your other options are services like Crunchyroll or Funamination, or even Amazon's Anime Strike (not even going into the fact that you need prime on top of the 5.99 service). Then you add on any other services you have like Hulu or HBO Go... And well, it's getting ridiculous, how many streaming services do these companies think we'll subscribe too before people just start turning towards pirating their favorite shows. It's getting to the point where all these service fees are adding up to an amount which is just too much for the average consumer... And so you either pick and choose which service you'll subscribe too and then the rest you just pirate, or you just pirate everything and subscribe to nothing (which I've been seeing more and more of recently).

I understand that Disney and DC will probably make more money by having their own streaming services... If the demand is high enough. But what I'm fearful of is other production companies and networks following suit and starting up their own pay streaming services. I don't know what the solution is, but I definitely believe that we are going to be seeing more and more streaming services geared towards individual brands and companies.

How many streaming services do you all pay for, and how many more would it take until you just started pirating? Or many you're already fed up and have taken the back road to watching your shows... I already gave up going to the theaters about 2 years ago, as it's just way too expensive, and it's not that hard to just ignore everything relating to the shows you're interested in... Until they come out on some sort of on demand rental service, like Xbox live or such.. I want to be able to pay for the shows and services I'm interested in, to support the artist and writers and actors... But it's becoming harder and harder to do so, as each is separating into their own services...

Cleopatra was indeed an Egyptian queen but she was **white of Macedonian descent.** Some people will say she had an Egyptian side, which is not true, but even if she did, Egyptians were not black or white. Egyptians lived along the Nile valley for centuries and probably millenniums developing their own characteristics and skin color of a golden tanned \~wheat like\~ skin tone, for reference you can use GOOGLE and look at any antient Egyptian statue or wall painting and look at what color it is, or ask anyone you know that visited Egypt before.

&#x200B;

What Netflix is doing here is following an Afrocentrism movement that is wrongly trying to steal Egyptian History and culture to assign it to central Africans for no historical reason just because we live on the same continent, when they had their own History and culture very far away from Egypt. I have no hate towards central africans, we are all humans we all live together, but we will not stand and watch other people steal my ancestry and history and just wave.

What Netflix did is not acceptable and I am sure it will not end here, with more Afrocentric shows to come, trying to steal more Egyptian heritage and maybe another culture after.

Then while waiting for the next season to finally see the conclusion of the cliffhanger the show either gets cancelled or the 2nd season is just another lead up to another cliffhanger. Never really coming to a good conclusion..

It really starts to make me hate watching tv shows no matter how good they are because I’m constantly feeling my time is being wasted by watching 8+ episodes and never actually concluding the seasons story. Instead they make the entire first season building up to that specific cliffhanger making the hours you watched wasted. 

I’m to the point where I’m just going to stick with watching movies which usually have a proper ending or older tv shows that have already concluded their stories. 

Why does every single show feel the need to do this?! If the show was good then that should be enough for us to be interested in another season. You can still build up a main story over multiple seasons but please for the love of god conclude the particular seasons story rather than having it always end on a cliffhanger.",,t3_o0qyix

2018-10-23 10:26:53,Submission,netflix,A Haunting of Hill House. A modern horror masterpiece.,"Horror, to me, is one of the toughest genres to work with when it comes to filming. It is extremely difficult to instill a sense of utter and real terror into the viewers. The way this series portrays its paranormal world is phenomenal. Some scenes were able to make me feel a sense of dread I have never felt before. 

In the beginning, I was absolutely terrified and I loved it!  By the end, I was accepting and understanding.  It’s terror, sadness, bitterness, regret, love and happiness; all wrapped together with brilliant writing. I couldn’t ask for more.

The journey this series takes you on is terrifyingly beautiful. It’s something you will rarely find in any movie or TV series. Its art. The writing was so well done I felt like I was wrapped up in a book! Not a show. 

And just when I thought the downfall of Netflix content was set in stone they just completely knock it out of the park with this masterpiece. 

The Hunting of Hill House by Michael Flanagan is probably the greatest horror series of the last decade. 

Keep it up Netflix.",D-sisive,t3_9qnnj7

A big reason we got netflix was to get away from advertisements.  In the past day we noticed that Netflix has started showing Ads between episodes of shows.  So on the countdown timer between episodes they now (could) have an ad.

This is something that would be a deal breaker for us, and so I called and told them that.

The only way we can influence them is by giving them feedback.  We like netflix, but I hope if other people are irritated by this move, they will give them feedback so they know that is the case.

Edit:

Based on questions below, we have only seen ads for ""produced by netflix shows"".  That might make a difference for you, but for me, an ad is an ad and it's worth it to take a minute to call and let them know how I feel.",deten,t3_983r2y

Irritated, I go back to the expanse and view the episode list, then just select play from beginning. Because that couldn't possibly mislead me, right? Nope. Fucking again, Amazon puts me into some other random show instead of the expanse. Fuckers.

2022-08-18 23:28:23,Submission,netflix,I am in South America and I can tell you how your future Netlflix will be and its awful,">**EDIT: A reporter contacted me to run a story about this** plus so many people have commented that it can't boil down to the SSID so I am going to clarify: I am not 100% sure it is the different SSIDs or the Wifi enhancer,etc. **What I am sure** is that no one was using my account except me and that Netflix doesn't disclose how exactly they track households. **Also this happened when we tried to watch Netflix downstairs as it was first working upstairs**. It is also true that the first representative said that if my Wifi was ""different"" then I needed an extra member wich costs extra $2.99. I tried to clarify whether that included the extender and he couldn't answer so I hang up and called again. The following two separate 1 hour calls were around doing the same steps over (changing passwords, logging out, explaining what was on the screen, etc) and over and they keep asking me if I was sharing my account (they asked multiple times). They'd put me on hold for 10 mins at the time so after a while I got fed up and hang up.

&#x200B;

Major Edit now that I am in front of my computer:

Netflix announced a pilot to [restrict password sharing in Latin America](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10870771/Netflix-runs-trial-crackdown-password-sharing-Peru-Chile-Costa-Rica.html) earlier this year. It's a test to then deploy it globally. Meaning, this is happening to me now but may happen to you next year.

Today my account got completely blocked because my house has two different WiFi signals, one upstairs and one downstairs. (It's a wifi enhancer). Same cable company, same bill but different SSIDs because the Wifi signal is not strong enough. After ~~1 hour~~  2 hours on the phone with Netflix they said I need to add an extra member if I wanted to watch TV downstairs!

I bet in a few months, they'll say it's one account per device and so on.

The streaming golden age for consumers is soon to end. Enjoy it while you can!

This is what ALL TVs in the house display after logging in. **You can see I am actually logged in** because there is a button to log out (or create an account). Already changed passwords to log out all devices and doesn't work. My account is bricked everywhere except for my computer. They keep asking the same questions (who are you sharing your account with. Who is watching Netflix right now (no one!)  etc...)

FINAL EDIT: Cancelled my account. Just when I was enjoying the Indian Matchmaker the most :/
